					<h5>Bio</h5>

						Sholan is a full time student by day and a Project Manager by night (until his work finds out). He likes to learn as much as he can and lives by the motto; "In order to earn more you have to learn more." 				
					</p>
					<p>
						He works at night and learns by day hoping to make a better life for himself. Sholan likes to learn a variety of subjects and is constantly listing to his hero Tony Robbins on audiobooks along with other successful entrepreneur authors. "Be Obsessed Or Be Average" is the book he is currently reading and is using these teachings to become Obsessed with JavaScript and Bootstrap, hoping to turn this obsession into success.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sholan holds a Certificate in Information Technology Support Services and is a dropout from Brock University (mostly due to being poor). When he is not at work or at school he is with his 4 month old daughter Borrklyn who is his everthing and his inspiration to keep moving forward.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sholan enjoys his privacy and is not part of any social media sites or apps, so he is not easily found or contacted dispite being super social and friendly.
